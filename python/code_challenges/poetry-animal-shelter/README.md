# Challenge Summary
Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.

## Whiteboard Process


## Approach & Efficiency

### enqueue

enqueue(animal): adds animal to the shelter. animal can be either a dog or a cat object.

Big O :
* time : O(1)
* space : O(1)

### dequeue
dequeue(pref): returns either a dog or a cat. If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.


Big O :
* time : O(n)
* space : O(1)

## Solution
```
-verification
1- step through the code and track the value
2-verfiy Big O of written code
3- verify code matches algorithm
4- explain testing according to input & output
